In this challenge, we need to implement an algorithm to find the output using the given key and data with operations related to concatenation, XOR, and SHA2-256. The program provided by our team - Ternary Stars, will support in solving this issue. We have used Python for this program.

Firstly, regarding the input information for decoding, we have declared them in the main part of the program. Key and Data are the input variables and can be changed as desired by modifying their content. Meanwhile, ipad and opad will be used to serve the subsequent algorithm when we need to concatenate hex characters "36" and "5c".

In addition, we have three other small functions to serve this program:

The first function corresponds to steps 1, 2, 3 in the description, used to check if the length of K (Key) is equal to B. The main purpose of this function is to generate the K0 string according to the requirements of the problem.

The second function is essentially the operation of processing two strings with XOR to create a new string. This is a necessary task for this program.

The third function helps us to obtain a new string by concatenating the K0 string with the ipad (or opad) string. This is also a part of the algorithm of the program.

Finally, we will get the desired result.
